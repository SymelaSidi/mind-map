Concept maps are especially useful in learning a new concept, from whatever domain it comes from. It is considered that it is easier through them to understand and memorize new knowledge. Concept map is the visualized diagram that shows the internal connection between different concepts and ideas. They are usually placed in a box-shaped or circle-shaped node. Lines then connect them together to form an entire knowledge map. It is known that the human brain processes image-like objects better than text. Therefore, the concept map is an excellent tool for understanding and memorizing new concepts, which is why it is now widely used in education.
